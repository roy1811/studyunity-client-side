                Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management, founded in 1995 by
                the Lal Bahadur Shastri Educational Society, has emerged as one
                of the country's top business schools. It is proud to be one of
                the leading institutes in providing value-based management
                education, thereby developing professionals with a humane and
                pragmatic approach on the path to corporate excellence. In
                Dwarka, New Delhi, the institute has cutting-edge infrastructure
                and a fully air-conditioned building.

                Admission dates for the Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of
                Management's PGDM (full-time) programme have been announced. The
                entrance exam, personal interview, and group discussion will
                take place from February to March 2023. The results will be
                revealed in April 2023. The institute's Dwarka campus is near
                the Delhi Metro line and thus easily accessible to students
                living anywhere in Delhi/NCR. Excellent arrangements for
                boarding, lodging, and other facilities have been made in Dwarka
                for students who wish to live close to the campus. The campus
                has excellent infrastructural facilities, including a
                magnificent auditorium with seating for 300 people and a massive
                library spanning two floors, which would be the envy of any
                business school in the country.
